# Pentesting-Honeypot-Lab
The labs included in this repository provide insight on some of the tools used with Kali to conduct network pen-testing experiments. Some of the included tools are Metasploit, Nmap, Zap, and many more. The labs provide instructions on manually installing the tools and provides some information on executing basic commands. There is also a lab on installing and using two types of honeypots, Pentbox and Valhala Honeypot. In order to conduct these labs, you will need both a Kali VM and a Windows 10 VM.
